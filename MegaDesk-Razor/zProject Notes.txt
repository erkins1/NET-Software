Class notes:
	When making the migration folder, make sure to add it to the .gitignore file
		Each computer needs to run its own "Add-Migration InitialCreate" to create the database on it

	Brother Thayne wants us to actually design the homepage as well
		It shouldn't look like the application, but should have similar buttons

	Be aware that when we save a quote, we are saving to 2 different classes

	Do not let the user enter or change the date field

	There was something about using the [BindProperty] in the create page 
		This is to help connect input fields to the classes?
		IDK exactly what it was, but pictures will be in the Discord


Classes:
	We can use the same classes as before, but some changes are nessecary

	No enums in these classes
		We will create new classes/tables for the materials and shipping attributes
			In those tables we can add prices

	Classes will not have inheritence, but will use foreign keys to refrence other tables/class ID's


Project Notes:
	Make sure the Desk, DeskQuote, Materials, and ShippingSpeed classes are set up

	Create Scaffolding

	Get SeedData ready to fill in Materials and ShippingSpeed tables

	Do the Initial Migrations for each computer

	Make the forms ready to create/edit quotes

	Make sure the forms are saving the quotes correctly

	Make sure that the forms show helpful information instead of foreign keys 

	Design the webpage


**IMPORTANT**
	Need to add the rushOrderPrices.txt in the bin to the respository
		I can't remember how to yet...

Potential Issues:
	Number of Drawers on the Create page is not a numeric up down
